# Description #
Very basic website template. Just includes Compass and SASS as well as file structure.

## How to Use ##
All Compass and SASS related files are in the /css/sass folder.
The config file is set up to be ready to go. For your edits in /css/sass/ css to be compiled automatically, run the watcher command `compass watch` within the root folder. Then all your changes in the SASS (.scss) files will be compiled into the /css folder.
